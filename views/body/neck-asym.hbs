          <p> Asymmetrical neck pain is a result of <b>repeated stress</b> and happens when you habitually favor the use of one side of the body over the other. 
              At work, this is often caused by sitting with the <i>head tilted/turned to one side</i> for long periods of time. </p>

          <p> This can also be caused by factors like the tendency to wear single-strap bags (purses, messenger bags, backpacks, etc.) or the preference for a particular side while sleeping. </p>

          <p class="directions"> Gently test for tender spots as you work your way up the muscle towards it's "head", which attaches just behind the ear.
